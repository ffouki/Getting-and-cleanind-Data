# Getting-and-cleanind-Data

The submission is under the project of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The run_analysis.R script performs the following 5 steps as described from the project after downloading the appropriate data file. 
o	Step1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
o	Step2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
o	Step3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
o	Step4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
o	Step5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The tidy output result from the above script is shown in the Final_tidy.txt file
